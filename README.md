# Smart-Stick-for-Visually-Impaired-and-Elderly

The research focuses on helping people who 
are elderly, partially impaired or blind, feel 
safe when they go out of their houses. It also 
focuses on keeping their families updated 
about their whereabouts at all times. This 
stick is an attempt to let these differently 
abled people have a chance at normalcy. 
This research contributes to the growing field 
of IoT and assistive technologies and 
highlights the potential for technology to 
address mobility challenges faced by the 
aging population and individuals with visual 
impairments. Our primary aim is to 
consolidate all the sensors and functionalities 
into a singular device to offer a 
comprehensive user experience.
